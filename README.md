# Technology Learning Studio<br /><br />
I am enrolled in Prof. Howison's Technology Learning Studio class for which I am going to do self-learning and portray my learning through projects. I am going to learn 3 technologies in the entire span of the semester and aim to achieve the below mentioned goals using the materials specified.<br /><br />

<h2><u>First Project : Tableau<br /></u></h2>
<h3>Goals</h3>Learning Tableau and implementing it on a data set to get some meaningful insights and analysis. I will be using dataset from WHO, UN and other reliable sources display the impact of lack of proper water and sanitation facilities.<br />
<h3>Materials</h3>I would be using tutorials and other training videos available on Tableau's websites and be a Forum's and user groups in case of issues and doubts. I am going to learn from the tutorials and courses on <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/tableau-learning-path/">Analytics Vidhya</a> and Coursera.<br /><br />
<h2><u>Second Project : SQL<br /></u></h2> <h3>Goals</h3>Making a database management project implementing SQL.
<h3>Materials</h3>
I am auditing Prof. Howison's Data Wrangling classes on Tueasdays and Thursdays at 10:30 to indulge myself in a peer learning for this project. I am going to use and refer to <a href="https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/">Mode SQL Tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">W3 Schools</a> while I am working on my project for help. <br /><br />
<h2><u>Third Project : 3-D Printing<br /></u></h2> <h3>Goals</h3>Learn 3-D printing and modelling. I will make a mechanical clock or a 3-d puzzle using 3-d printing techniques.
<h3>Materials</h3>I am going to be using <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/tutorials">Shapeways</a> and 
<a href="http://3dprintingforbeginners.com">3d Printing for Beginners</a> to learn from 3d software tutorials. I will be auditing Prof Riley's class on Wednesdays at 12 PM to learn better about 3d printing and modelling.<br /><br />

<h2><u>Week 1<br /></u></h2>

I got a chance to visit a Tableau day event, where talking to people helped me understand the basic differences between the 3 types of Tableau versions available; Desktop, Online and Server. Since it was an event organized to discuss the most recent features that are available and very useful, I got a chance to know about some amazing options to play with data, make dashboards, and update the people effected.<br /><br />

I took an example data set with 5 datapoints and implemented all sorts of charts and graphs to see the different visualizations, realizing what is used best when. Once I was done exploring the data I pulled from the excel sheet, I learnt how to connect Tableau with different data sources like databases and sharepoint.<br /><br />

<h2><u>Week 2<br /></u></h2>

I expanded my dataset to the ideal scenario of comparing current growth to the expected growth. When I was trying to implement that, my biggest chalenge was to make it most readible and comprehended. The easiest options were not the best one as they plotting it above one another or next to each other as the below screenshot.

After seeing a lot of blogs and videos, I learnt the feature of Dual axis and the synchronization of the axes, it was easier to see the comparision. <br /><br />

Though I still felt that having the dual axis (though synchronized) is not a very good interpretation. Then I discovered a trick to get rid of the 2 axes and combine it in one depicting it by 2 different colors.
